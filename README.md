# VBA – challenge
This project creates a VBA script to analyze stock market dataset.


## About:
This project provides a vba script that loops through all the stocks data for one 
year and outputs the relevant information.

## Data source:
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.

## Features:
1. The script loops through one year of stock data and reads/ stores all of the 
following values from each row.
      •    The ticker symbol
      •    Volume of stock
      •    Open price
      •    Close price
2. On the same worksheet as the raw data, all columns were created for:
      •    ticker symbol 
      •    Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year 
           to the closing price at the end of that year.
      •    The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a  
           given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
      •    The total stock volume of the stock. 
3. Script also calculates and displays the following values:
       "Greatest % increase", 
       "Greatest % decrease"
       "Greatest total volume". 
4. Conditional formatting is done to highlight positive change in green and 
negative change in red to yearly change column and percent change column.
